# Project Overview

## ETL Implementation

Implemented ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to facilitate data generation and cleaning. This involved:

- **Extract**: Retrieving data from various sources, particularly JSON files.
  
- **Transform**: Structuring and cleaning the data to make it suitable for analysis. This process ensured data quality and consistency.

- **Load**: Efficiently loading the processed data into a database for storage and retrieval.

## Database Management with MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas

Employed MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas for efficient database management on a server. The integration with Python was seamless, allowing for streamlined data handling. Key aspects of this implementation include:

- **Extensive Databases**: Maintained extensive databases on a server using MongoDB.

- **Integration with Python**: Ensured seamless integration with Python, enabling easy interaction with the databases.

## Data Transfer to SQLite Database

Transferred data from retrieved JSON sources into an SQLite database for structured storage. This step involved:

- Structuring the data into a suitable format for SQLite.

- Creating a well-organized database for structured storage.

# Data Visualization

Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create meaningful data visualizations, enhancing data interpretation and presentation. This involved:

- Creating visually appealing and informative charts and graphs.

- Enhancing the overall data interpretation experience for users.
